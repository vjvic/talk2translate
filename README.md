# Talk2Translate

Talk2Translate is a voice translation app I developed to explore real-time translation and voice input integration. It uses SpeechRecognition to capture spoken input and OpenAI’s API to provide text translation, allowing for smooth and interactive user experiences.

Key Learnings:

- Integrating SpeechRecognition for voice input, enhancing user interaction through speech-to-text conversion.
- Utilizing OpenAI API for text translation, focusing on API integration and dynamic data handling.
- Developing responsive, modern UIs with Tailwind CSS for intuitive design.
- Leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering and performance optimization.
- Strengthening my skills in TypeScript for type safety and managing complex application states.
- Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with speech recognition, real-time translation, and frontend development, pushing my understanding of building scalable, accessible web applications.
